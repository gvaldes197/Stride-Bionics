    <h2>Helping Stroke Survivors Walk Independently</h2>
    <p>The Strider is a next-gen robotic exoskeleton that aims to enable safe, unsupervised walking in the real world.</p>
    <p><strong>Currently under development. This device is NOT FDA cleared and cannot be sold or marketed until FDA clearance is granted.</strong></p>

    <h2>About Stride Bionics</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>The Strider is a powered lower-limb exoskeleton designed specifically for stroke rehabilitation. Unlike traditional rehab robots that require a therapist or caregiver, Strider is being designed for safe, independent use at home or in the community.</p>
      <p>Our system uses adaptive feedback control and real-time safety monitoring to help users walk again with confidence - no upper limb power, no bulky cables, no clinical tethering.</p>
      <p class="disclaimer">This device is not FDA cleared and is not available for sale or clinical use.</p>

    <h2>User Testimonials</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <p><strong>Michael, age 63 (stroke survivor):</strong><br/>
        "I've tried exoskeletons in the clinic, but they always required someone to be with me. Strider's promise of independence is what really gives me hope."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <p><strong>Dr. Lisa Tran, PT, DPT:</strong><br/>
        "The Strider could be a game-changer for outpatient care. Patients want to regain control outside the clinic - this is the first concept I've seen that's designed with that goal from day one."
